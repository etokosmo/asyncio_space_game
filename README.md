# Space Game

## About

The game is a reflection of the global problem of mankind. The Earth's orbit is littered with garbages: parts of rockets, debris from satellites, parts of the ISS.

The idea of the game is to show how hard it is to take off through the garbage.

The game starts from the year the first satellite was launched (1957). With each subsequent year, the amount of garbages in space increases. After the year 2000 you are given access to a gun with which you can blow up garbages.

You need to maneuver between pieces of garbages and explode if possible. The longer you fly, the more garbages you encounter.
